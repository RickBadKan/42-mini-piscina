<h1>Django Summary</h1>
<p>
  Django is a free and open-source, Python-based web framework that follows the
  model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern. It is maintained by the
  Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established in
  the US as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.
</p>
<p>
  Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven
  websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of
  components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of
  don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files,
  and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read,
  update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through
  introspection and configured via admin models. Some well-known sites that use
  Django include Instagram, Mozilla, Disqus, Bitbucket,
  Nextdoor and Clubhouse.
</p>
<h1>Django History</h1>
<p>
    Django was created in the fall of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper, Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, began using Python to build applications. Jacob Kaplan-Moss was hired early in Django's development shortly before Simon Willison's internship ended. It was released publicly under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist Django Reinhardt. Adrian Holovaty is a Romani jazz guitar player and a big fan of Django Reinhardt.
</p>
<p>
    In June 2008, it was announced that a newly formed Django Software Foundation (DSF) would maintain Django in the future.
